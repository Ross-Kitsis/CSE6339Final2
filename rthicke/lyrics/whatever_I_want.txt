(I can do whatever I want)
Ooh baby
(I can do whatever I want)
Finally
(I can do whatever I want)
Freedom
(I can do whatever I want)
Freedom
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over

Now that the monkey on your back is gone
Now that the pain and regret have moved along 
Now that you finally have some piece of mind
Who knows what buried treasure you might find, oh lord

(I can do whatever I want)
Oh yes you can baby
(I can do whatever I want)
I'm talkin', talkin' 'bout freedom
(I can do whatever I want)
Freedom my love
(I can do whatever I want)
Freedom
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)

Deeply intrigued by what you’ve never had
Emotion explosions none of which are mad
Now every dream you feel is coming true
Cause there ain’t nobody to tell you what to do

(I can do whatever I want)
Oh yes you can baby
(I can do whatever I want)
I'm talkin', talkin' 'bout freedom
(I can do whatever I want)
Freedom my love
(I can do whatever I want)
Freedom baby
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
All over my body
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
Say alright now dance

(Dance with me, dance with me)
Yeah baby, baby, come on, come on
(Dance with me, dance with me)
All I want do is dance with you
(Dance with me, dance with me)
I got, got, got to dance with you
(Dance with me, dance with me)
Dance with you, come on

(I can do whatever I want)
Ooh baby
(I can do whatever I want)
She, she got that freedom
(I can do whatever I want)
Freedom
(I can do whatever I want)
Come on now, now, now
(I can do whatever I want)
She could do whatever she want

She got that freedom
Freedom baby
She got that freedom
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
I kiss you all over your body baby
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
I want to kiss you all over, over, over
(Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me)
Your body, body, body, body, body baby

(I can do whatever I want)
Oh yes you can my love
(I can do whatever I want)
She could do whatever she want
(I can do whatever I want)
Freedom
