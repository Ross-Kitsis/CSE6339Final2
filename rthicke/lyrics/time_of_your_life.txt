This is the time of your life
Let's celebrate, not ask each other why
She’s standing there beside you
Touch her hand let it guide you
She’s just looking for somebody to love

This is the moment of your life
Everything’s changed it all gonna turn out right
We don’t know how this little fairy tale ends
Good thing we will always be best friends
Well this is the time of your life
Live it up drink it down
Get up off the ground, take flight
If you practice the right moves
Maybe you’ll see
Everything fits so perfectly
It’s the time of your life, yes it is

She wants to know if everybody’s looking
She doesn’t know that she’s got that thing
She wants to know if anybody’s looking
She doesn’t realize
