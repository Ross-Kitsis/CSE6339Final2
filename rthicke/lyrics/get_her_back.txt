All I wanna do
Is keep it light
Keep it light
Keep you satisfied
All I wanna do
Is make it right
Make it right
Is make you smile tonight
All I wanna do
Is give you that thing, play you that song, you and your girlfriend sing
All I wanna do
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight

I never should have raised my voice or made you feel so small
I never should have asked you to do anything at all
I should have kissed you longer
I should have held you stronger
And I'll wait for forever for you to love me again

All I wanna do
Is keep it light
Keep it light
Keep you satisfied
All I wanna do
Is make it right
Make it right
Is make you smile tonight
All I wanna do
Is give you that thing, play you that song, you and your girlfriend sing
All I wanna do
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight

Oh, it’s so hard
It’s so hard
Oh, it’s so hard
Oh, it’s so hard
But it doesn’t have to be

'Cause all I wanna do
Is keep it light
Keep it light
Keep her satisfied
All I wanna do
Is make it right
Make it right
Is make you smile tonight
All I wanna do
Is give you that thing, play you that song, you and your girlfriend sing
All I wanna do
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight

'Cause all I wanna do
Is keep her love
Keep her love
Keep her satisfied
All I wanna do
Is make it right
Make it right
Is make you smile tonight
All I wanna do
Is give you that thing, play you that song, you and your girlfriend sing
All I wanna do
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight
