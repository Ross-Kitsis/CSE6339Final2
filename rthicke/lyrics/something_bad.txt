There’s something bad in me
(Something, something)
Ah, there’s something bad in me
(something, something)
Yeah there’s something bad, something bad, something real real bad
(Something, something)
There’s something ba-ba-ba-bad in me (bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad)

(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Aww yeah
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Oh yeah, I've been so bad baby, bad baby
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby)

In my blood in my veins something’s got me by the reigns
Try to run but I’ve been staring down the barrel of a gun
A liar under pressure feeling mighty dressed up
Look at me I’m showing off again ‘cause vanity’s my only friend
I’m in pieces of a puzzle if you ever even finish babe it won’t be worth the muscle
But take a leap of faith and baby land in my bed
But don’t you be surprised if I end up messing up your head There’s something bad in me

There’s something bad in me
(Something, something)
Ah, there’s something bad in me
(something, something)
Yeah there’s something bad, something bad, something real real bad
(Something, something)
There’s something ba-ba-ba-bad in me (bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad)

(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Aww yeah
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Oh yeah, I've been so bad baby, bad baby
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby)

She’s a princess but not from kings and queens
Pink Lips on my fingers ears and ankles
I’m a fiend
Beautiful secrets that nobody’s supposed to keep
A bird flew in the window took a picture and left with a naughty tweet
I try to be deep before I do bad things
But it feels so good right now how wrong could this be
I know you wanna fly so baby open up your wings
Then I’ll walk out with your legs shaking while you’re screaming Robin please

There’s something bad in me
(Something, something)
Ah, there’s something bad in me
(something, something)
Yeah there’s something bad, something bad, something real real bad
(Something, something)
There’s something ba-ba-ba-bad in me (bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad)

(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Aww yeah
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Oh yeah, I've been so bad baby, bad baby
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) I've been so bad
(You been such a bad baby, bad baby)

I’m in pieces of a puzzle
If you ever put together won’t be worth the years of trouble
With me you’ll wanna do things for the very first time
Tonight I’m all yours but in the morning
I’m all mine

There’s something bad in me
(Something, something)
Ah, there’s something bad in me
(something, something)
Yeah there’s something bad, something bad, something real real bad
(Something, something)
There’s something ba-ba-ba-bad in me (bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad)

(You been such a bad baby, bad baby) Aww yeah
