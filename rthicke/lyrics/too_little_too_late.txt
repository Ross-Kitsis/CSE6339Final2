Too little too late, too little too late
Too little too late, too little too late

Every time you walked through that door
I should’ve held you so long you would never ever need to ask for more

Every time you walked through that door
I should’ve spun you around and around like the kitchen was the dance floor
Every time you walked through that door
Should’ve listened fixed it kissed it healed it not belittled it
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Should’ve made you feel special and treated you right

(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don’t you say it baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don’t you say it say it say it now
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I’m down on my knees baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Baby baby please

(Too little too late, too little, too late)
No, no, no, no, no
(Too little too late, too little, too late)
(Too little too late, too little, too late)
I love you baby
(Too little too late, too little, too late)

Every time you walked through that door
Should’ve bought white roses good and plenty and rubbed your toes
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Shoulda woulda coulda
Should’ve shown some R-E-S-P-E-C-T

(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don’t you say it baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don’t you say it say it say it right now
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don't say it's too late
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Baby baby please

(Too little too late, too little, too late)
No, no, no, no, no
(Too little too late, too little, too late)
(Too little too late, too little, too late)
I love you baby
(Too little too late, too little, too late)

Every time you walk through that door
Should’ve waited patient thanked you spanked you pleased you feed you
Every time you walked up in this house baby
Should’ve cheered you feared you knew a day would never come when I don’t need you

(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don't say it's too late
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don't you leave me, leave me, leave me lonely
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Don't say it's too late
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Oh my lord
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I get down on my knees
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I'm begging you please baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I will if you wait for me baby
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
Baby baby please
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
No, no, no, no
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
No don't you say it
(It’s too little, too little, too late)
I love you baby
Baby baby please
