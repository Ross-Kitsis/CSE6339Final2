Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel real good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?

If I told you that I love you
Would you run away
Or would you run to me
I need to know it baby

If I gave you all my lovin'
Would you give it back
What would you do with that
I ask a lot of that
And if I gave you all my time
When it's the summertime
And all my downtime
Yeah, that's a lot of times
If I'm fallin over you,
Then what you gonna do
I wanna come with you
I wanna run with you

I give you all my lovin to you
I give you all my lovin to you
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel real good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?

If I partied till the mornin' would you stay with me
Girl would you play with me
Or would you hate on me

If I run all out of money
Would you pay for me
Or would you stray from me
I need to know it babe
If there's something I could do to make you see the light
Girl that I'll treat you right
I'll do it every night
Every second that I'm with you it's a special world
Like I'm your only man
And you're my only girl

I give you all my lovin to you
I give you all my lovin to you
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel real good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?

Does it feel good?
Oh babe oh darling
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?

I give you all my lovin to you
I give you all my lovin to you
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel real good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
Does it feel good?
