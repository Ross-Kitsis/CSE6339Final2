All that she wants is the honesty
All that she wants is the opposite of me
All that she wants is someone who doesn’t hurt
All that she wants is the action not the words

Oh the action not the words
It’s the action not the words

If she ever knew that I would never be the man I promised I would be
If she ever knew that I was gonna be runnin’ around she would’ve never stayed
All that she needs is a good man
All that she needs is another try
All that she needs is something that I can’t give her
I just can’t give her

All that she wants is the honesty
All that she wants is the opposite of me
All that she wants is someone who doesn’t hurt
All that she wants is the action not the words

Oh the action not the words
It’s the action not the words
Oh the action not the words
It’s the action not the words

And all that she needed was a true friend
All she received was a troubled man
And she couldn’t be with someone like her dad
And I just rewarded her with my drunken rants
And all that she needs is a good man
All that she needs is another try
All that she needs is something that I couldn’t give her
I just can't give her

All that she wants is the honesty
All that she wants is the opposite of me
All that she wants is someone who doesn’t hurt
All that she wants is the action not the words

Oh the action not the words
It’s the action not the words
Oh the action not the words
It’s the action not the words
