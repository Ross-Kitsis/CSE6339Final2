I'm moving to New York

Turn me up baby
Black Daddy (YEAH!)
I said Black Daddy (YEAH!)

I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
I’m livin’ in New York
I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
In the center of the world

I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
Wait ‘til you see what I do
I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
To find somebody like you

I said me (me), you (you), N (N) Y (Y)
Why not, (why not), why not, (why not), why not, (why not)

I’m walking my bulldog baby (YEAH!)
In the middle of Central Park
Takin’ over downtown baby (YEAH!)
Long after it gets dark
Every night is a mystery (YEAH!)
Baby I just can’t sleep
I gotta stay out all night (YEAH!)
So you can find me

I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
I’m livin’ in New York
I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
In the center of the world

I said Black Daddy (YEAH!)

I thought I was livin’ (YEAH!)
‘Till I woke up to a siren
I thought I was over (YEAH!)
‘Till I met these New York soldiers
They keep on working
(keep on working)
They keep on fighting (keep on fighting) America (America)
It’s time to wake up (time to wake up)

‘Cause I’m livin’ in New York City
I’m livin’ in New York
I’m livin’ in New York City
In the center of the world

I’m livin’ in New York City
Where girls are pretty, streets are witty
I’m livin’ in New York City
Where everybody’s livin’, and everybody’s winning
I’m livin’ in New York City
Where streets are witty, girls look pretty
I’m livin’ in New York City
And it’s, and it’s, and it’s livin’ in me

Good god (YEAH!)

I said me (me), you (you), N (N) Y (Y)
Why not, (why not), why not, (why not), why not, (why not)

I gotta testify, I gotta testify
Good god (YEAH!)
Testify
Good god (YEAH!)
I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
I’m livin’ in New York City (YEAH!)
I'm livin' it up, livin' it up. livin' it up
Good god (YEAH!)
And he's livin' in me (YEAH!)

Is livin' in me now (YEAH!)
How I'm livin' it up, livin' it up
Cause he's livin' it up
Me (me), you (you), N (N) Y (Y)
Why not, (why not), why not, (why not), why not, (why not)
