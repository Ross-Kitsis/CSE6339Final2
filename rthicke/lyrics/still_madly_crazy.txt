What can I say
Oh what can I do
When I'm crazy, so crazy for you
And I try not to show it
And I can't control it
I'm still madly crazy for you
See the birds fly
See the blue sky
See the best times of my life
Watch me crawl, watch me beg
Watch me fall deep
Cause I, I just can't stop
I just can't stop thinking 'bout those days
Under sunshine too much wine
Laying in the grass, you were all mine
So free just like heaven
Or what I expect
Heaven will be
Soaked up in love baby
Just you and me

What can I say
Oh what can I do
I'm crazy, so crazy for you
I try not to show it
I just can't control it
I'm still madly crazy for you

Every night you'd close your eyes on my chest
Like it's home
And you say, "until that happened you just can't fall asleep"
"Without you laying your head on me"
But I was in chains in the rain
Lost my soul, now you know
So sorry you had to suffer my lack of self-control
You think by now I might've grown

What can I say
Oh what can I do
I'm crazy, so crazy for you
I try not to show it
But my heart can't control it
I'm still madly crazy for you

Oh yeah yeah
Still madly crazy for you
Oh What can I say
Oh what can I do
I'm crazy, so crazy for you
I try not to show it
But my heart just can't hold it
I'm still madly crazy for you
