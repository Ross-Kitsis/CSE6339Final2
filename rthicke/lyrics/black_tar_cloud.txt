Emergency, Emergency
There’s a black tar cloud all because of me
Emergency (911) Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)

(Tell ‘em the truth)
You’re packing up quickly the baby’s at Grandmas
The raging coast is far from clear (truth)
You’re yelling and screaming and smacking me
How could you do this you spoiled little rich kid (truth)
A rock in the TV
You bashin' my ride up, you smashed my guitar
(Tell ‘em the truth)
Chasing me around the house swinging 
trying to hit me with my favorite golf club (truth)
You revved up the car
You smashed through the gate
I ran up the street (truth)
I waited an hour to cool off
When I came back it was too late (truth)

You were lying in bed (truth)
Said you took twenty pills (truth)
Now I’m calling the ambulance, police, 
I’m freakin' out till you said chill 
Baby I didn't really take them pills
I’m just desperately crying for help

All because of me (911)
Aww emergency (911) yeah Emergency (911)
There’s a black tar cloud (black tar)
All because of me (911)

(Tell ‘em the truth)
I was licking your wounds
I thought we were straight (truth)
I thought everyone was gonna eat the chips
Turns out I’m the only one who double dipped (truth)
Face down in a puddle of shame (tell ‘em the truth)
Drowning in suffering, self-sabotaging
The one thing that always made life seem ok (truth)
I was jealous of your light, jealous of your soul
Good morning manipulation and control

One heart was more than enough
One body wanted too much (truth)
One kiss it wanted to stay
One hand always misbehaved
(Tell ‘em the truth)
One eye looked around the room
One eye looked inside itself and finally (truth)
Finally saw the truth yeah
