One, two, look at you
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking
(­knocks)

She was born in Paris at the age of 21
Love knew her, but she didn’t know love
Love didn’t hear her when she cried, love didn’t stand by her side
On the most important nights, oh yeah

But now she’s flying high you can’t hurt her no more
Now she’s locked the door because you broke the key
And she got a bright smile on her face now that she got that little
Taste
She just wants more, she just wants more

She locked the door
(I kept trying to tell you you were pushing me too far)
She locked the door
(I kept trying to warn you you were slowly breaking my heart)
She locked the door
(I kept giving you all I had but you took way too much)
She locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked that door
(And I don’t know what this is but I know this ain’t love)

One, two, look at you
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking
(­knocks)

One morning the tears started rolling down her empty face
That sparkle in her eye had been abruptly replaced
When I touched her she said wait, when I kissed her she pulled away 
And I knew it was over, cause she had nothing left to say

But now she’s flying high you can’t hurt her no more
Now she’s locked the door because you broke the key
And she got a bright smile on her face now that she got that little
Taste
She just wants more, she just wants more

She locked the door
(I kept trying to tell you you were pushing me too far)
She locked the door
(I kept trying to warn you you were slowly breaking my heart)
She locked the door
(I kept giving you all I had but you took way too much)
She locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked that door
(And I don’t know what this is but I know this ain’t love)

One, two, look at you
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking
(­knocks)

Baby let me in, baby I miss my best friend, yes I do
She locked the door, you can’t hurt her no more
She locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked that door

She locked the door
(I kept trying to tell you you were pushing me too far)
She locked the door
(I kept trying to warn you you were slowly breaking my heart)
She locked the door
(I kept giving you all I had but you took way too much)
She locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked that door
(And I don’t know what this is but I know this ain’t love)

Don’t leave me out here in the cold
Ooh turn the porch light on
At least open the doggy-door
Throw a friend a juicy bone
Baby please give me a little hope, all I need is a little hope

One, two, silly fool
Three, four, she locked the door
I keep knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking
